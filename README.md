Project #7
Server-Client Message Passing through sockets.

Project #8
Server-Client File Transfer through sockets.

Project #9
To Write a Program which stores the temperature and humidity data (received by the raspberry pi from the DHT 11 sensor) in a database. Then use that database to host a webpage in a local server that displays that data.

Project #10
To display Temperature and Humidity data on Android Application with client-server socket-based data transfer using Android Application as Client and Raspberry Pi as Server.

Project #11
To receive Temperature and Humidity data form multiple devices connected with DHT 11 sensor in a single server (On the Same Local Area Network) and store that data in a database in the Server Machine. Then use that database to show the latest data in a local server as well as in multiple Android devices connected on the same Local Area Network.

Project #12
To store Temperature and Humidity data form multiple devices connected with DHT 11 sensor in a cloud database. Then use that database to show the latest data in a webpage as well as in multiple Android devices.
